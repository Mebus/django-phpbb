django-phpbb - Django PhpBB integration

To do list:

- Add support for bbcode
  - Option 1: use http://code.google.com/p/postmarkup/
    - Issues: Doesn't support integration with a real phpBB database
  - Option 2: port original bbcode[1].
- Add support for access control, at the very least determining which forums
  should be publicly visible and which shouldn't.
